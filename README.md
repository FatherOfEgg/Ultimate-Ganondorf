# Ultimate-S Ganondorf

Ganondorf is my favorite character, and the team behind Ultimate-S made him so strong. 
This repository is a port of his major mechanics introduced.

## What was ported from Ult-S 

### Up-Tilt

Gone is the Vacuum kick, Ganondorf's new up-tilt is now an anti-air / combo-extender.

### Neutral Special 
In lieu of his warlock punch, Ganondorf has been given two new abilities:

1. When used on the ground, Ganondorf will teleport in the direction he's facing. In 
this state, he is completely intangible until the teleport is complete. Opponents
near the portal will be blown away.

2. When used in the air, Ganondorf will enter his float. Ganondorf can move freely in the air for a short
time, and can perform all of his aerials. With exception to his side-special, Ganondorf 
will exit his float. Float can only be used one time in the air, and can only be reset 
if... 
    - You touch the ground.
    - You lose a stock.
    - You land a successful side-special or up-special.

### Warlock Punch 

Just kidding, Ganondorf still has this ultra-powerful move. It can be activated by 
pressing either the left or right taunt button.


## Changes from Ult-S 

### Neutral Special (Air)
- Floating is an automatic state. One no longer needs to hold the special button to keep 
the float going. 
- If you already used your float and press the special button again, Ganondorf will 
not be locked in the float animation. 

### Side Special (Air)
- If used during a float status, you can launch a super-charged grab with the right 
inputs! If facing right, move your control stick all the way left, then all the way right, 
and quickly hit the special button.

### Down Special 
- Instead of a second button press, you can hold the special button to cancel the 
move earlier.

### Warlock Punch
- Instead of the high taunt activating this move, the left and right taunt buttons control 
the Warlock Punch as well as Ganondorf's turn direction. 
- If floating and you press the special button, Ganondorf will use the Warlock Punch in 
the direction he is currently facing.
