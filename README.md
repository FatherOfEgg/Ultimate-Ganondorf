# Ultimate Ganondorf
Ganondorf is my favorite character. Ultimate S and WuBoy did a lot of really amazing things with him. Try to incorporate the best of both worlds and create a character that he could have 
been if he was DLC.

## Changes from Ult-S 

### Float mechanic
- Float no longer requires one to hold the special button to keep the float going.
- Float automatically cancels after two consecutive attacks.
- You can do a warlock punch by pressing the special button after the float started.
- With correct timing, you can extend the range of all your specials. Side-special across the stage, up-special from the depths, and down-special from heaven.
