# Ult-S-Ganondorf
Ganondorf is my favorite character, and Ultimate S did a lot of really amazing things with him. Port Ganondorf as a downloadable mod.

## Changes from Ult-S 

- If Ganondorf hits someone with his neutral special, he can cancel it.
- Float no longer requires one to hold the special button to keep the float going.
- To cancel Wizard's Kick, hold the special button instead of hitting it on frame 24.
